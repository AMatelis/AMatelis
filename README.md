# 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew Matelis

I am a student passionate about coding deep learning models for disease detection, with a special interest in biomedical AI. My most impressive project so far is developing a deep learning model to analyze blood flow velocity using speckle imaging.

I’m planning to compete in science competitions like ISEF and JSHS in the upcoming school year to further explore my research interests.
