# Andrew Matelis

I am a rising junior focused on biomedical AI and deep learning, applying machine learning to analyze biological and medical data. My research centers on non-invasive blood flow analysis, disease detection, and predictive modeling in chemistry and biology.

## Projects
- **Speckle Flow Estimation:** Deep learning pipelines to estimate blood flow velocity from speckle videos (2D & 3D CNNs).  
- **Pneumonia Detection:** Early detection model using ICU patient data.  
- **Elements Reaction Predictor:** Predicts chemical reactions using public and self-generated datasets.  
- **FTC Robotics Code:** Modular code controlling robotic mechanisms for competitions.  

## Skills
Python, Java, PyTorch, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn. Expertise in deep learning, computer vision, biomedical imaging, and microfluidics.

## Goals
Compete in ISEF and JSHS, explore optical and computational methods for blood flow analysis, and build reproducible AI pipelines.
