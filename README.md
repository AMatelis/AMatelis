# Andrew Matelis

I am a rising junior focused on biomedical AI and deep learning, particularly applying machine learning to analyze biological and medical data. My current research centers on non-invasive blood flow analysis, disease detection, and predictive modeling in chemistry and biology.

I am interested in taking complex problems and turning them into working models that provide **meaningful insights into real-world systems**.


## Research and Projects

### Speckle Flow Estimation
Developed deep learning pipelines to estimate blood flow velocity from speckle pattern videos using 2D and 3D CNN architectures. Emphasis on **quantitative flow measurement and classification**.  
**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, OpenCV  

### Pneumonia Detection
Created a deep learning model for early detection of pneumonia using ICU patient data. Focused on **high-accuracy medical imaging predictions**.  
**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, Pandas  

### Elements Reaction Predictor
Predicts chemical reactions between elements using deep learning. Combines **public datasets with self-generated data** to explore reaction patterns.  
**Tech:** Python, PyTorch  

### FTC Robotics Code
Codebase controlling robotic mechanisms and sensors for competition robotics. Focused on **modular, reusable code for robotics systems**.  
**Tech:** Java
